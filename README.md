# NixOS Configuration

## Description

My, Dylan Turner's, personal nixos configuration to be cloned as `/etc/nixos/` and used in `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

It sets up my computer's drivers and desktop experience and even my dot files, so I can easily move them from PC to PC and edit them in one place.
